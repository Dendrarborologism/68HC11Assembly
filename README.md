# 68HC11Assembly
Each of the ten files provided contains near the top a description of the program within's purpose, as well as detailed c-style pseudocode that should help further illuminate exactly what the code is doing on a higher level of abstraction. To run any of these programs, first install Wookie, which is a plain but very useful editor and emulator for the 68HC11 microcontroller. Load the program in from your machine, then assemble and run it. The user interface streamlines this process quite a bit, but don't expect anything too flashy; this is assembly after all...
